**WebRTC is a free, open project** that provides browsers and mobile applications with Real-Time Communications (RTC) capabilities via simple APIs. The WebRTC components have been optimized to best serve this purpose.  
  
**Our mission:** To enable rich, high-quality RTC applications to be developed for the browser, mobile platforms, and IoT devices, and allow them all to communicate via a common set of protocols.  
  
The WebRTC initiative is a project supported by Google, Mozilla and Opera, amongst others. This page is maintained by the Google Chrome team.
